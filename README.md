# Disclaimer

### The Code

This was one of my earlier projects, looking at the codebase will tell you just how early

As a result, it has very many bugs, memory and overall performance issues

It is unlikely that I will find time to fix any of them

### The Setting

This game is very loosely based on real events that occurred between Israel and Syria a very long time ago. I chose this point in history simply because I could then give the game a cool name. The game in **no way** reflects any of my personal views about anything
